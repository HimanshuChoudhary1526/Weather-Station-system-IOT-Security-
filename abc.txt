Q1 Analyse the best case, worst case and average case time requirement for linear search. Compare it with binary search.

Q2 Analyse the best case, worst case and average case time requirement for selection sort. Compare it with bubble sort algorithm.
Selection sort explanation:
Consider sorting n numbers stored in array A by first finding the smallest element of A and exchanging it with the element in AOE1. Then find the second smallest
element of A[1]. Then find the second smallest element of A and exchanging it it with A[2]. Continue in this manner for the first n-1 elements of A. Write pseudocode for this algorithm, which is known as selection
sort.
